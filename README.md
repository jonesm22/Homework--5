# In order to show that n is not prime, take p = prime, so p = 2
# Then take 2^n mod(n-1). If this is congruent to 1 then n
# is prime, else it is composite, by Fermat's Little Theorem. 

# I tried doing this in sage but it would not compute 2^n,
# on the basis that the power was too big. This, though,
# is the method in which we would show n to be composite.
